    <h2>What I know about Marvel</h2>
    <p>
        What I know of the Marvel universe is that there's no Batman. 
    </p>
    <p>
        Marvel was started in 1939 by Martin Goodman under
        a number of corporations and imprints but now known as Timely Comics, and by 1951 had generally become known
        as Atlas Comics. The Marvel era began in 1961, the year that the company launched The Fantastic Four and other
        superhero titles created by Stan Lee, Jack Kirby, Steve Ditko and many others. The Marvel brand, which had been
        used over the years, was solidified as the company's primary brand.
